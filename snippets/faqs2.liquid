Do you ship orders internationally? If so, how will orders be shipped?
Yes, we ship internationally and we've partnered with Passport Shipping and they will get the order to your local carrier.
Also, international customers are responsible for paying customs duties/taxes/VAT to their individual governments when the product arrives at their destination country. 
Please allow some extra time since orders frequently get held up in Customs. This is no fault of ours or the shipping company. This is up to each individual country's government. 
We DO NOT offer refunds for any reason while products are IN TRANSIT. We will of course always work with you once you receive the products or before we ship them!
